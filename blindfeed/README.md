# blindfeed-test

A simple app that comsumes the 'http://xkcd.com' api to show comics
The project was built as a 4 hour test for blindfeed in October 2018 (I think)

The app is in vuejs and uses `Axios` for http calls to const server 'https://xkcd.now.sh', I remember this because the original API had some CORS issues and some champion on github was nice enough to write a wrapper.

## NB: I have not touched this application since submition in 2018 and it is not a reflection of my current skill level, it is simply a fun project I did once upon a time.

Since this project I have used more reactjs and SCSS, but sometimes I still go back to vue, its a nice framework.
